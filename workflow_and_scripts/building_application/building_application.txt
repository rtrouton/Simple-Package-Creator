Once you have created the Automator application, you will need to do the following steps:

1. Unzip the following files:

* workflow_scripts_and_icons/icon/Simple_Package_Creator_Folder_Icon.zip
* workflow_scripts_and_icons/icon/Simple_Package_Creator_Icon_icons.zip

2. Give the Automator application the Simple Package Creator.app folder icon.

3. Go into Simple Package Creator.app/Contents/Resources and remove the following file:

ApplicationStub.icns

4. Rename the unzipped application_icons.zip file to be ApplicationStub.icns and copy it to Simple Package Creator.app/Contents/Resources.
